## Reporting a Vulnerability

if you find a vulnerability, please do reach us on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YayinLabs), to update and fix the
reported vulnerability it might take some time as we use open source themes so we will verify and reach to the authors of that repository, 
if the vulnerability is accepted we will try our best based on severity to give a token giftcard to our online store.
